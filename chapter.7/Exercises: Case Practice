1. The following should return x when x is greater than y.
functionC x y = if (x > y) then x else y
functionC x y = case (x > y) of
  True -> x
  False -> y

2. The following will add 2 to even numbers and otherwise simply
  return the input value.
  ifEvenAdd2 n = if even n then (n+2) else n

  ifEvenAdd2 n = case (even n) of
    True -> (n+2)
    False -> n

3. The following compares a value, x, to zero and returns an indi-
    cator for whether x is a postive number or negative number. But
    what if x is 0? You may need to play with the compare function a
    bit to find what to do.
    nums x =
      case compare x 0 of
        LT -> -1
        GT -> 1
        EQ -> 0

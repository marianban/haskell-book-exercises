1. You can query the type of a value in GHCi with the :type com-
mand, also abbreviated :t. Example:
Prelude> :t False
False :: Bool
What is the type of data constructor MakeExample? What happens
when you request the type of Example?
MakeExample :: Example

2. What if you try :info on Example in GHCi? Can you determine
what typeclass instances are defined for the Example type using
:info in GHCi?
data Example = MakeExample 	-- Defined at <interactive>:55:1
instance [safe] Show Example -- Defined at <interactive>:55:37

3. Try making a new datatype like Example but with a single type
argument added to MakeExample, such as Int. What has changed
when you query MakeExample with :type in GHCi?

data Example = MakeExample Int deriving Show
MakeExample 10 :: Example

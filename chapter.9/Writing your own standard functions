1. myOr returns True if any Bool in the list is True.
module MyOr where
  myOr :: [Bool] -> Bool
  myOr [] = False
  myOr (x:xs) = x || myOr xs

2. myAny returns True if a -> Bool applied to any of the values in
the list returns True.
module MyAny where
  myAny :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
  myAny _ [] = False
  myAny f (x : xs) = f x || myAny f xs

Example for validating myAny:
Prelude> myAny even [1, 3, 5]
False
Prelude> myAny odd [1, 3, 5]
True

3. After you write the recursive myElem, write another version that
uses any.

-- the built-in version of 'elem' in GHC 7.10
-- and newer has a type that uses Foldable
-- instead of the list type specifically. You
-- can ignore that and write the concrete
-- version that works only for list.
module MyElem where
  myElem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
  myElem _ [] = False
  myElem x' (x : xs) = x' == x || myElem x' xs

Prelude> myElem 1 [1..10]
True
Prelude> myElem 1 [2..10]
False

4. Implement myReverse.
myReverse :: [a] -> [a]
myReverse = undefined
Prelude> myReverse "blah"
"halb"
Prelude> myReverse [1..5]
[5,4,3,2,1]

5. squish flattens a list of lists into a list
module Squish where
  squish :: [[a]] -> [a]
  squish [] = []
  squish (x : xs) = x ++ squish xs

6. squishMap maps a function over a list and concatenates the re-
sults.
module SquishMap where
  squishMap :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
  squishMap _ [] = []
  squishMap f (x : xs) = f x ++ squishMap f xs
Prelude> squishMap (\x -> [1, x, 3]) [2]
[1,2,3]
Prelude> squishMap (\x -> "WO "++[x]++" HOO ") "123"
"WO 1 HOO WO 2 HOO WO 3 HOO "

7. squishAgain flattens a list of lists into a list. This time re-use the squishMap function
module SquishAgain where
  squishMap :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
  squishMap _ [] = []
  squishMap f (x : xs) = f x ++ squishMap f xs
  squishAgain :: [[a]] -> [a]
  squishAgain = squishMap (\x -> x)

8. myMaximumBy takes a comparison function and a list and returns
the greatest element of the list based on the last value that
the comparison returned GT for. If you import maximumBy from
Data.List, you’ll see the type is:
Foldable t => (a -> a -> Ordering) -> t a -> a
rather than
(a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a
module MyMaximumBy where
  myMaximumBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a
  myMaximumBy f (x : xs) = m f xs x where
    m :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a -> a
    m _ [] y = y
    m f (x : xs) y = m f xs (if (f x y == GT) then x else y)
Prelude> let xs = [1, 53, 9001, 10]
Prelude> myMaximumBy compare xs
9001

9. myMinimumBy takes a comparison function and a list and returns
the least element of the list based on the last value that the
comparison returned LT for.
module MyMiminumBy where
  myMinimumBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a
  myMinimumBy f (x : xs) = m f xs x where
    m :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> a -> a
    m _ [] y = y
    m f (x : xs) y = m f xs (if (f x y == LT) then x else y)
Prelude> let xs = [1, 53, 9001, 10]
Prelude> myMinimumBy compare xs
1

Using the myMinimumBy and myMaximumBy functions, write your own
versions of maximum and minimum. If you have GHC 7.10 or newer,
you’ll see a type constructor that wants a Foldable instance
instead of a list as has been the case for many functions so far.
myMaximum :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a
myMaximum = myMaximumBy compare
myMinimum :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a
myMinimum = myMinimumBy compare

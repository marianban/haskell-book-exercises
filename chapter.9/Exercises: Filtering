1. Given the above, how might we write a filter function that would
give us all the multiples of 3 out of a list from 1-30?

filter (\x -> (x rem 3) == 0) [1..30]

2. Recalling what we learned about function composition, how
could we compose the above function with the length function
to tell us *how many* multiples of 3 there are between 1 and
30?

length . filter (\x -> (x `rem` 3) == 0) $ [1..30]

3. Next we’re going to work on removing all articles (’the’, ’a’, and
’an’) from sentences. You want to get to something that works
like this:
Prelude> myFilter "the brown dog was a goof"
["brown","dog","was","goof"]
You may recall that earlier in this chapter we asked you to write a
function that separates a string into a list of strings by separating
them at spaces. That is a standard library function called words.
You may consider starting this exercise by using words (or your
version, of course).

module MyFilter where
  myFilter :: String -> [String]
  myFilter xs = filter pred (words xs) where
    pred :: String -> Bool
    pred x
      | elem x ["the", "a", "an"] = False
      | otherwise = True

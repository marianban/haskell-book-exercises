1. Modify your fibs function to only return the first 20 Fibonacci
numbers.
first20fibs = take 20 fibs
2. Modify fibs to return the Fibonacci numbers that are less than
100.
fibsLessThan100 = takeWhile (<100) fibs
3. Try to write the factorial function from Recursion as a scan.
You’ll want scanl again, and your start value will be 1. Warning:
this will also generate an infinite list, so you may want to pass it
through a take function or similar.
factorials = scanl (*) 1 [1..]
